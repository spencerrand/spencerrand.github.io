Eveyone knows that the temperature gets hotter as you approach the equator, but can we use data to definitely prove it?
I wrote a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities across the world.  The cities were chosen at random so that they are of varying distances from the equator.

The script makes an API request to OpenWeatherMap and creates a representative model. 

There are four charts:

<ol>
  <li>Temperature (F) vs. Latitude</li>
  <li>Humidity (%) vs. Latitude</li>
  <li>Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude</li>
  <li>Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude</li>
</ol>
